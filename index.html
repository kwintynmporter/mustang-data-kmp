    oh wow you're still reading this? Wanna hear my favorite joke? 
    Why did the banker quit his job? 
    Because he lost interest.
    He lost everything, his wife, the kids.
    It's actually kinda sad. 
    I feel bad now.
    Are you still reading this? 
    Get back to work. 
    I'm not your boss but, I mean...............
